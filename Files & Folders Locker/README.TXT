Based on the file lock program submitted by Pierre Aoun on PSC
Added a lot of modifications to make it more useful
This is a program I intend to release commercially in the near future but have submitted it here for peer review
It is still under development and therefore they may be objects included that are not being used at present.


special thanks to Pierre Aoun for the very useful insight on the file or folder handle locking.
To those coders who always selflessly share code on PSC, this is my way of saying thanx as I have learned a lot from you guys.

Please to all coders and folks on PSC: your suggestions, comments and votes
are badly needed so as to help me improve on the program and make it more
secure. You can write to me or drop a mail if you think of any feature that needs
to be implemented or you find sections of code that can be made more useful. Thank you.

File list:
Loadhigh.txt
registry.txt
lockinfo.mdb
README.TXT
File & Folder Locker.exe.manifest

Rename loadhigh.txt to loadhigh.exe, registry.txt to registry.dll
copy file regisry.dll to \system32 and register it.
compile the program and run the file loadhigh.exe.
Note: if you are using win2000 then create the folder (c:\windows\system32)

Features include: 
1. Stealth startup? (curtesy Dr. Y  mosibatzadeh@yahoo.com)
2. Multi-user environment
3. view protected objects per user basis
4. Tempering proof (program shuts down automatically on files modification or deletion).
